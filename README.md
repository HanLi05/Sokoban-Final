### Sokoban Remake
# Project Description
This project is a remake of the puzzle game called Sokoban. The goal is to move your character around a board, pushing moveable crates around immoveable walls into certain locations. The challenge of the game arises when you push a crate against a wall, since you can only push it in a single direction instead of two from that point on. I created it on repl.it around a year ago on my high school account which got disabled after I graduated. Because of this, I've copied the entire project and pushed it to Github all at once, which is why there is only a single commit.
